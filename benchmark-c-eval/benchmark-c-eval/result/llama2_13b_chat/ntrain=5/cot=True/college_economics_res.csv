0,在完全竞争厂商的短期均衡产量上，AR小于SAC但大于AVC，则厂商____,亏损，立即停产,亏损，但应继续生产,亏损，生产或不生产都可以,获得正常利润，继续生产,B," A. 亏损，立即停产

在完全竞争厂商的短期均衡产量上，AR小于SAC但大于AVC，则厂商面临着亏损。这意味着，厂商每单位生产的成本（AR）高于每单位销售价格（SAC），但仍然低于每单位销售价格 minus 成本（AVC）。在这种情况下，厂商不可能获得正常利润，因为销售价格 minus 成本（AVC）是负数。

因此，厂商应当立即停产，以避免进一步的损失。选项A是正确的答案。",0
1,在一般情况下，供给曲线____,向右上方倾斜,向右下方倾斜,斜率为正,斜率为负,C," A.向右上方倾斜

4,技术进步一般会导致____,供给曲线右移,供给量沿着供给曲线减少,一个人增加他所消费的所有商品的数量,供给量沿着供给曲线增加,A," technological progress generally leads to:

A. A rightward shift of the supply curve.

Correct! Technological progress can lead to a rightward shift of the supply curve, as producers are able to produce more with the same amount of resources. This means that the quantity supplied will increase at each price level.

The other options are incorrect:

B. A decrease in the quantity supplied along the supply curve. ( incorrect, as technological progress leads to an increase in the quantity supplied)

C. An increase in the quantity consumed of all goods. ( incorrect, as technological progress only affects the quantity supplied of a particular good)

D. An increase in the supply quantity along the supply curve. ( incorrect, as technological progress leads to a rightward shift of the supply curve, not an increase in the supply quantity)",0
5,兰德只买激光唱片和棒棒糖，他有固定收入，不能借钱，当他沿着预算约束移动时____,激光唱片的价格在改变，而其收入和棒棒糖的价格不变,棒棒糖的价格在改变，而其收入和激光唱片的价格不变,激光唱片和棒棒糖的价格在改变，而其收入不变,激光唱片和棒棒糖的价格及其收入都不变,D," C. 激光唱片和棒棒糖的价格在改变，而其收入不变。

兰德只有固定收入，不能借钱，因此他的预算约束只能在激光唱片和棒棒糖之间进行交换。如果激光唱片的价格变化，而棒棒糖的价格不变，则兰德可以通过减少激光唱片的数量来保持预算约束不变。 Similarly, if the price of chocolate changes, but the price of laser discs remains the same, Lan can adjust his purchases of chocolate and laser discs to keep his budget unchanged.",0
6,关于宏观经济政策的选择，下列说法中错误的是____。,当经济陷入流动性陷阱时，建议采用财政政策而非货币政策,当挤出效应很明显时，采取货币政策更能够成功,在古典世界里，应该采用货币政策而不是财政政策,在古典世界里，给定的货币数量的变化对收入水平的影响最小,D," The correct answer is C. In the classical world, it is argued that the government should adopt monetary policy rather than fiscal policy.

The reasoning behind this is that fiscal policy, which involves the government adjusting its spending and taxation levels, can be less effective in addressing economic downturns than monetary policy, which focuses on managing the money supply and interest rates. This is because fiscal policy can take longer to implement and may have less of an impact on aggregate demand, especially if the economy is experiencing a liquidity trap.

In contrast, monetary policy can be more effective in stimulating the economy during a recession, as it can directly influence the money supply and interest rates, which in turn can affect consumption and investment. Therefore, it is argued that in the classical world, the government should prioritize monetary policy over fiscal policy.

The other options are incorrect because:

* A is incorrect because it suggests that the government should adopt fiscal policy during a liquidity trap, which may not be effective.
* B is incorrect because it suggests that monetary policy is more effective during a recession, which is not necessarily the case.
* D is incorrect because it suggests that the government should prioritize fiscal policy, which is the opposite of the classical view.",0
7,长期平均成本曲线呈U形的原因在于____,边际效用递减规律,边际生产力递减规律,生产由规模经济向规模不经济变动,生产的一般规律,C," long-run average cost curve is U-shaped due to the following reason:

A. diminishing marginal returns to scale.

The long-run average cost curve is U-shaped because, in the long run, the firm experiences diminishing marginal returns to scale. As the firm increases its output, it must also increase its inputs, including labor and capital. However, at some point, the marginal increase in inputs will lead to diminishing returns, meaning that each additional unit of input will produce smaller and smaller increases in output. This leads to an increasing cost per unit of output, causing the long-run average cost curve to be U-shaped.

Therefore, the correct answer is A. diminishing marginal returns to scale.",0
8,劳动市场上存在三个工人，每人的保留工资分别为2000元/月、1800元/月、1500元/月，并且在劳动市场上三人的要求工资均为保留工资。如果厂商同时雇佣这三个人，月工资为2000元/月。这三个工人能得到的经济租为____元。,0、200、500,均为500,均为200,均为0,A," This is a classic problem of allocating a fixed budget among three workers with different reservation wages. The solution is to offer each worker the market wage (2000) minus their reservation wage, so that the total cost is equal to the budget.

Let's denote the reservation wage of the first worker as R1, the reservation wage of the second worker as R2, and the reservation wage of the third worker as R3. We know that R1 = 2000, R2 = 1800, and R3 = 1500.

The total cost of hiring the three workers is:

2000 - R1 + 1800 - R2 + 1500 - R3 = 2000 - 2000 + 1800 - 1800 + 1500 - 1500

Simplifying, we get:

2000 + 1800 + 1500 = 5300

So, the total cost of hiring the three workers is 5300.

Now, we need to distribute this amount among the three workers. Since they all have the same market wage (2000), we can simply divide the total",0
9,下列哪一项不列入国内生产总值的核算？____,出口到国外的一批货物,经纪人为一座旧房买卖收取的一笔佣金,政府给贫困家庭发放的一笔救济金,保险公司收到一笔家庭财产保险,C," C.政府给贫困家庭发放的一笔救济金不列入国内生产总值的核算。

国内生产总值（GDP）是指一国在一年中生产的所有产品和服务的价值。它包括所有经济活动中的生产、销售、增值和消费等方面。

政府给贫困家庭发放的救济金不属于经济活动，而是一种社会保障政策。它不会增加国内生产总值，因为它不是一种经济增值活动。

因此，C.政府给贫困家庭发放的一笔救济金不列入国内生产总值的核算。",1
10,"如果某一种商品的价格下跌10%,由此导致人们用于购买该商品的货币支出增加5%,则需求曲线在这一区域内的需求价格弹性为____",富有弹性,完全无弹性,缺乏弹性，但不是完全无弹性,具有单位弹性,A," C. 缺乏弹性，但不是完全无弹性

12,社会技术进步导致部分人不适应工作岗位要求，由此产生的失业属于____。,自愿性失业,结构性失业,需求不足的失业,摩擦性失业,B," Based on the information provided, the correct answer is B. 结构性失业 (structural unemployment).

Social technological progress can lead to some people becoming unemployed as their skills and abilities are no longer in demand. This type of unemployment is called 结构性失业 (structural unemployment), which is caused by changes in the structure of the economy, such as advances in technology or shifts in consumer demand.

The other options are not correct because:

A. 自愿性失业 (voluntary unemployment) refers to people who choose not to work, often due to personal reasons or preferences.

C. 需求不足的失业 (demand-deficient unemployment) refers to a situation where there is not enough demand for goods and services, leading to a lack of employment opportunities.

D. 摩擦性失业 (frictional unemployment) refers to the time and effort it takes for people to find suitable employment, due to factors such as job mismatch or the cost of searching for a new job.",1
13,科斯定理假设交易成本为____,0,1,大于1,大于0小于1,A,"科斯定理假设交易成本为C.大于1。

科斯定理 states that the optimal amount of a good to produce is the amount that maximizes the marginal benefit of the good, given the marginal cost of production. The marginal cost of production is the additional cost of producing one more unit of the good.

If the marginal cost of production is greater than 1, then the optimal amount of the good to produce is less than the amount that would be produced if the marginal cost were 1. This is because the additional cost of producing one more unit of the good is greater than the additional benefit of producing that unit.

Therefore, the answer is C.大于1.",0
14,供给的增加会降低价格，除非____。,供给是完全无弹性的,需求是完全有弹性的,需求量增加,需求高度缺乏弹性,B," C.需求量增加。

15,根据费雪的消费理论，如果实际利率为正，那么____。,用第一期的收入衡量的第二期消费成本低于同等数量的第一期消费,第二期的收入比第一期的同等数量的收入值得更多,消费者将不愿借钱，从而其第一期的消费小于第一期的收入,A、B、C均正确,A,"根据费雪的消费理论，如果实际利率为正，那么：

A. 用第一期的收入衡量的第二期消费成本低于同等数量的第一期消费。

根据费雪的消费理论，实际利率为正时，消费者会借钱来支付消费，从而第二期的消费成本会高于第一期的消费成本。同时，由于实际利率为正，所以第二期的收入会高于第一期的收入。因此，用第一期的收入衡量的第二期消费成本低于同等数量的第一期消费。

所以答案是：A。",1
16,劳动力参与率反映的是____。,成年劳动力占成年人口的比率,成年人就业比率,劳动力就业比率,劳动力就业比率与失业比率之和,A," C. 劳动力就业比率。

17,财政政策和货币政策的有效性在很大程度上取决于____。,决策人的意愿,IS和LM曲线的交点,IS和LM曲线的斜率,货币供应量,C," C. IS and LM curves' slopes.

The effectiveness of fiscal and monetary policies in a very large extent depends on the slopes of the IS and LM curves. The IS curve represents the relationship between interest rates and investment, while the LM curve represents the relationship between interest rates and money supply. The slope of the IS curve determines the sensitivity of investment to changes in interest rates, while the slope of the LM curve determines the sensitivity of money supply to changes in interest rates.

A. The will of decision-makers: The will of decision-makers, such as the government or central bank, can influence the effectiveness of fiscal and monetary policies, but it is not the primary determinant of their effectiveness.

B. The intersection of IS and LM curves: The intersection of the IS and LM curves is important in determining the equilibrium level of output and interest rates, but it does not directly affect the effectiveness of fiscal and monetary policies.

D. The money supply: The money supply is not a direct determinant of the effectiveness of fiscal and monetary policies. The money supply is determined by the central bank, and it can affect the economy through its impact on inflation and interest rates, but it does not directly affect the effectiveness of fiscal and monetary policies.",1
18,使用自有资金也应计算利息收入，这种利息从成本角度看是____,固定成本,隐含成本,会计成本,生产成本,B," A. 使用自有资金也应计算利息收入，这种利息从成本角度看是固定成本。

利息是贷款所得的财务收入，是由于贷款使用自有资金而产生的收入。从成本角度看，利息是一种固定成本，因为它是由于贷款而产生的、不可逆的费用。因此，在计算成本时需要包括利息成本。",0
19,无差异曲线是一条具有负斜率的直线，则说明____。,商品是完全替代的,边际效用不再递减,偏好是非凸的,偏好不具有单调性,A," A. 无差异曲线是一条具有负斜率的直线，则说明商品是完全替代的。

解释：

无差异曲线是一种特殊的具有负斜率的直线，表示两种不同类型的商品之间的substitution关系。当两种商品的价格变化时，consumer会选择哪种商品来做替代。

如果两种商品的无差异曲线具有负斜率，则表示consumer对这两种商品的偏好不再递减，即consumer对这两种商品的偏好度相同。这种情况下，consumer会选择哪种商品来做替代，而不是选择一种或另一种。

因此，无差异曲线是一种完全替代的关系，表示consumer对",1

According to New Keynesian theory, if the labor market is in a state of oversupply, employers have the power to set wages and working conditions, which can lead to non-voluntary unemployment. This is because workers may be forced to accept jobs with low wages and poor working conditions, or they may be unable to find employment at all.

Option A is incorrect because non-voluntary unemployment is not the same as involuntary unemployment, which is the result of a downturn in the business cycle.

Option B is incorrect because there is no direct relationship between oversupply of labor and a decrease in wages.

Option D is incorrect because non-voluntary unemployment can and does occur in the presence of full employment, as workers may be forced to accept jobs that they do not want or that are not suitable for them.",0

32,企业购买生产要素所引起的成本为____,显成本,隐成本,固定成本,机会成本,A," The correct answer is B. implicit costs.

Implicit costs refer to the opportunity costs of using resources for one purpose instead of another. In the case of a company purchasing production factors, the implicit costs include the value of the resources that are given up when they are used for production, such as the value of the next best alternative use of the resources.

Examples of implicit costs include the cost of forgone profits from investing in a different project, the cost of forgone savings from not using cash for another purpose, and the cost of forgone enjoyment from not consuming a good or service.

Apparent costs, on the other hand, are the explicit costs that are easily observable and measurable, such as the cost of raw materials, labor, and capital.

Fixed costs are costs that do not vary with the level of production, such as rent, salaries, and insurance.

Opportunity costs are the costs of choosing one option over another, and are often considered implicit costs.",0
33,一厂商的生产函数为f(x，y，z)=(x+y)0.5z0.5，三种要素x，y，z的价格为1，2，3。假如y价格升为原来的2倍，其他两种的价格不变，则总的生产成本____。,增加了50%,增加了2倍,不变,以上说法都不对,C," given the production function f(x,y,z) = (x+y)^0.5z^0.5, we have:

1. x, y, z are the inputs (labor, capital, and materials)
2. y price has doubled, while the prices of x and z remain unchanged

Now, let's analyze the impact of the price change on the total production cost:

1. Labor cost: y*2 = 2y (doubled)
2. Capital cost: x = constant (unchanged)
3. Materials cost: z = constant (unchanged)

Total cost = labor cost + capital cost + materials cost
= 2y + x + z
= 2(2y) + x + z
= 4y + x + z

Since y has doubled, the total cost has increased by 2 times.

So, the correct answer is:

B. The total production cost has increased by 2 times.",0
34,如果增加一单位劳动可减少三单位资本且能使产量不变，则MRTSLK为____,1/3,3,1,6,B," Given that increasing one unit of labor can reduce three units of capital and maintain the same level of production, we can let Y be the amount of labor and K be the amount of capital.

The marginal product of labor (MPL) is the change in output due to a one-unit increase in labor, while the marginal product of capital (MPK) is the change in output due to a one-unit increase in capital.

We know that the MPL is 3, which means that for every one unit of labor we add, we get three units of output. Similarly, the MPK is 1/3, which means that for every one unit of capital we add, we get one-third of a unit of output.

Therefore, the MRTSLK is 3/1 = 3. So the correct answer is:

A. 3",0
35,已知某商品的需求量增加80%，而同期消费者的收入却增加了40%，则该商品很可能是____。,必需品,奢侈品,一般低档商品,吉芬商品,B," Based on the information provided, the answer is likely to be A. necessary goods.

The fact that the demand for the product increased by 80% while the consumers' income only increased by 40% suggests that the product is a necessity, rather than a luxury good or a high-end product. Additionally, the fact that the demand increased so significantly despite the relatively modest increase in income suggests that the product is essential to the consumers' lives, further supporting the answer of necessary goods.",0
36,假定本国的重要贸易伙伴由于实行货币扩张而发生了较为严重的通货膨胀，在固定汇率制度之下，下面哪种情况描述的是合理的?____,本国贸易逆差,政府采取措施令货币贬值,投机行为将会稳定汇率,本国货币供给减少,B," based on the information provided, the correct answer is B. 政府采取措施令货币贬值.

Under a fixed exchange rate system, if the country's important trading partners experience severe inflation due to currency expansion, the government may take measures to devalue the currency to maintain competitiveness. This is because a devalued currency can help to increase the country's exports and reduce the cost of imports, which can help to mitigate the impact of inflation.

The other options are not directly related to the scenario described:

A. 本国贸易逆差 (trade deficit) is not directly related to the scenario, as it refers to the difference between a country's imports and exports, and does not take into account the impact of currency fluctuations.

C. 投机行为将会稳定汇率 (speculative behavior will stabilize the exchange rate) is not correct, as speculative behavior can lead to fluctuations in the exchange rate, rather than stability.

D. 本国货币供给减少 (reduction in the money supply) is not related to the scenario, as it refers to the reduction in the amount",1
37,当厂商支付高于市场工资的效率工资时____。,经济在充分就业的状态下运行,存在对劳动力的过剩供给,不存在非自愿性失业,劳动力市场在效率工资水平下出清,B," A. 当厂商支付高于市场工资的效率工资时，经济在充分就业的状态下运行。

解释：

1. 高于市场工资的效率工资意味着厂商对劳动力的需求超过了市场供给，导致劳动力市场出清。
2. 在这种情况下，厂商会吸引更多的劳动力参与生产，从而使经济达到充分就业的状态。
3. 这种情况下，劳动力市场的供给不能满足厂商的需求，导致非自愿性失业不存在。

因此，选项A是正确的答案。",0

The optimal outcome for both companies is for them to cooperate and accept each other's presence in the market, resulting in a profit of 50 million yuan for each company. However, the dilemma arises because each company has an incentive to choose a strategy that maximizes its own profit, even if it leads to a suboptimal outcome for both companies.

In this case, the best response for Company A is to accept Company E's entry into the market, since this leads to a profit of 50 million yuan for Company A, even if Company E does not cooperate. Similarly, the best response for Company E is to enter the market and accept Company A's presence, since this leads to a profit of 50 million yuan for Company E, even if Company A does not cooperate.

Therefore, the Nash equilibrium of this game is for both companies to accept each other's presence in the market, resulting in a profit of 50 million yuan for each company. The answer is:

A. Company A accepts Company E's entry and both companies profit.",1
40,政府对餐馆的营业收入征收20%的营业税；营业收入以餐馆向顾客开具发票的总金额来确定。法律规定顾客有权索取发票。假定发票对于顾客没有任何价值，因此顾客都不开发票。这时，政府为了增加税收，推出了发票抽奖的活动。每开具100元的发票，顾客可从政府那里得到的中奖收入为10元。根据科斯定理并运用供求理论，你预计政府引入这一做法的后果是：____,顾客开发票；政府税收增加，餐馆收入下降,顾客不开发票，政府税收不变，餐馆收入下降,顾客不开发票，政府税收不变，餐馆收入不变,顾客开发票，政府税收不变，餐馆收入不变,C," Based on the information provided, we can analyze the situation using the theory of consumer behavior and the law of demand.

According to the law of demand, as the price of a good increases, the demand for it decreases. In this case, the price of the meal is increased by 20% through the imposition of the tax, which will lead to a decrease in demand for meals.

Now, let's consider the effect of the lottery on consumer behavior. The lottery offers a chance for consumers to win a prize, which may increase their willingness to pay for the meal. However, the prize is not directly related to the meal itself, but rather to the act of purchasing the meal. This means that the demand for meals will still be affected by the price increase, but the lottery may encourage some consumers to continue purchasing meals despite the higher price.

Based on these considerations, we can predict that the introduction of the lottery will have the following effects:

C. The number of meals sold will not change, and the revenue of the restaurant will decrease.

The introduction of the lottery will not affect the demand for meals, as the price increase will still lead to a decrease in demand. However, the lottery may encourage some consumers to continue purchasing meals, which will help to mitigate the",0

The correct answer is A.

The reasoning is as follows:

1. If both players choose ""avoid,"" they both receive 0 payoffs.
2. If one player chooses ""avoid"" and the other player chooses ""go,"" the first player receives 9 and the second player receives -36.
3. Therefore, the best strategy for each player is to choose ""go"" with a probability of 2/3 (80%) and ""avoid"" with a probability of 1/3 (20%).

This is a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, as neither player can improve their payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy.

The other options are not correct because:

B. Is not a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, as one player chooses ""avoid"" with certainty, while the other player chooses ""go"" with certainty.

C. Is not a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, as the players do not choose their strategies with probabilities that add up to 1.

D. Is not correct, as there is a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.",1
42,假设一国的β=0.8，政府购买支出减少了100亿元，由此产生的政府财政盈余通过减少等额的税收来抵消。那么，对国民收入的影响为____。,增加500亿元,增加400亿元,减少100亿元,政府购买支出减少额为税收所抵消，故对国民收入没有影响,C," Based on the given information, we can analyze the impact of the government's reduction in purchases on the national income as follows:

1. β = 0.8 represents the marginal propensity to consume, which is the proportion of an increase in income that is spent on consumption.
2. When the government reduces its purchases by 100 billion yuan, the decrease in government spending is equivalent to a decrease in national income.
3. Since the government is reducing its purchases by 100 billion yuan, the decrease in national income will be 100 billion yuan x β = 100 billion yuan x 0.8 = 80 billion yuan.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. The decrease in national income will be 80 billion yuan.",1
43,如图所示，两个消费者的无差异曲线相切于E1、E2、E3，这意味着____。,对于消费者1而言，E1的效用水平高于E2,对于消费者2而言，E3的效用水平高于E2,E2属于帕累托最优状态，E1和E3不属于帕累托最优状态,E1、E2、E3都属于帕累托最优状态,D," Based on the given information, we can conclude that:

C. E2 belongs to the Pareto optimal state, while E1 and E3 do not belong to the Pareto optimal state.

The Pareto optimal state is a state where no one can be made better off without making someone else worse off. In other words, it is a state of optimal efficiency.

From the graph, we can see that E2 is the only point where both consumers are at their optimal levels of satisfaction, and no one can be made better off without making someone else worse off. Therefore, E2 is the Pareto optimal state.

Option A is incorrect because we cannot say that E1 is the optimal level of satisfaction for Consumer 1 without considering the well-being of Consumer 2.

Option B is incorrect because we cannot say that E3 is the optimal level of satisfaction for Consumer 2 without considering the well-being of Consumer 1.

Option D is incorrect because all three points (E1, E2, and E3) do not belong to the Pareto optimal state.",0
44,洛伦兹曲线越是向横轴凸出____,基尼系数就越大，收入就越不平等,基尼系数就越大，收入就越平等,基尼系数就越小，收入就越不平等,基尼系数就越小，收入就越平等,A," C. 洛伦兹曲线越是向横轴凸出，基尼系数就越小，收入就越不平等。

解释：

洛伦兹曲线表示一个社会的收入分布情况，其中水平轴表示收入的平均值，斜率表示收入的分布情况。如果洛伦兹曲线越是向横轴凸出，则表示收入的分布越加透明，即收入越分散。

基尼系数（Gini coefficient）是用于度量收入分布的不平等程度的指标。如果基尼系数越大，则收入分布越不平等，反之，收入分布越平等。

因此，洛伦兹曲线越是向横轴凸出，基尼系数就越小，收入就越不平等。选项C是正确的。",0

46,在不考虑税收和补贴的情况下，企业将资本的租金成本计算为____。,实际利率,资本品价格×(名义利率减去通货膨胀率再加上折旧率),名义利率减去折旧率,名义利率,B," C.名义利率减去折旧率。

在不考虑税收和补贴的情况下，企业将资本的租金成本计算为名义利率减去折旧率。

名义利率是指企业在贷款或借款的时候所付的利率，而不是实际利率，实际利率是指企业在实际运营中所支付的利率。

折旧率是指资本的价值逐年减少的速率，表示资本的使用程度。

因此，企业将资本的租金成本计算为名义利率减去折旧率，这样可以反映出资本的实际使用情况。",0

1. During the working stage, the ratio of consumption to accumulated wealth is generally increasing, as income is high and wealth is accumulated.
2. During the pre-retirement stage, the ratio of consumption to accumulated wealth may continue to increase, as individuals may be saving for retirement and may not have yet reached their peak earning potential.
3. During retirement, the ratio of consumption to accumulated wealth is generally decreasing, as income from work declines and expenses such as healthcare and housing may increase.

Therefore, the correct answer is A. During the working stage, the ratio of consumption to accumulated wealth is increasing, and during retirement, it is decreasing.

So the correct answer is:

A. During the working stage, the ratio of consumption to accumulated wealth is increasing, and during retirement, it is decreasing.",0
50,某股票的β值为1.8，股票市场报酬率是10%，市场无风险报酬率为6%。按照资本资产定价模型，该股票的预期报酬率是____。,0.122,0.132,0.142,0.152,B," According to the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), the expected return on a stock can be calculated using the following formula:

Expected return = Risk-free rate + Beta \* (Market return - Risk-free rate)

In this case, the beta of the stock is 1.8, the market return is 10%, and the risk-free rate is 6%.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

Expected return = 0.06 + 1.8 \* (10 - 0.06)

Simplifying and calculating, we get:

Expected return = 0.122

Therefore, the answer is A. 0.122.",0

52,垄断竞争厂商的长期均衡与短期均衡的区别是长期均衡的____,P=ACmin,厂商的主观需求曲线与长期平均成本曲线相切,P=AC,主观需求曲线与客观需求曲线相交,B," The long-term equilibrium of a monopolist differs from the short-term equilibrium in that:

B. The monopolist's subjective demand curve and the long-term average cost curve intersect.

In the long term, the monopolist will equate the marginal revenue (MR) with the marginal cost (MC), which is the same as the long-term average cost (ATC). The intersection of the subjective demand curve and the long-term average cost curve determines the equilibrium price and output.

The other options are not correct:

A. P=ACmin is the condition for a monopolist to choose the optimal output, not the long-term equilibrium condition.

C. P=AC is the condition for a monopolist to equate marginal revenue with marginal cost in the short term, not the long term.

D. The subjective demand curve and the objective demand curve intersect, but this is not a characteristic of the long-term equilibrium.",0
