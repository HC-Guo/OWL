1. Three coins all land with the same side up (either heads or tails). In this case, the payoff is 0 for both players.
2. Two coins land with the same side up, and the third coin lands with the opposite side up. In this case, Player 1 pays Player 2 10 times the number of coins that landed with the same side up.
3. Two coins land with the opposite sides up, and the third coin lands with the same side up. In this case, Player 2 pays Player 1 10 times the number of coins that landed with the opposite sides up.

Since the players play multiple rounds, we need to calculate the expected value of each outcome. Let's assign a value of 1 to each coin landing with the same side up, and a value of -1 to each coin landing with the opposite side up.

For outcome 1, the expected value is 0.

For outcome 2, the expected value is 10(number of coins with the same side up).

For outcome 3, the expected value is -10(number of coins with the opposite sides up).

Since the players play multiple rounds, the expected value of the game is the sum",0

Let's call the length of the special track ""L"". The athlete takes 50 seconds to run one lap of the track at a speed of 6 meters per second. Therefore, the distance they cover in one lap is:

Distance = Speed x Time = 6 meters/second x 50 seconds = 300 meters

Now, let's consider the triangle formed by the athlete's path as they run from one end of the track to the other. The athlete starts at one end of the track, runs to the opposite end, and then turns around and runs back to the starting point. The distance they cover in this process is:

Distance = 2 x L

Since the athlete runs at a speed of 6 meters per second, the time it takes them to cover this distance is:

Time = Distance / Speed = 2L / 6 = L / 3

Now, we know that the athlete takes 50 seconds to run one lap of the track. Therefore, the time it takes them to run from one end of the track to the other and back is:

Time = 2 x L / 3 = 2L / 3 x 2 = L / 6

35,我们发现零工制度有一个重要的支持机制就是完善的、科学化的员工培训系统。几乎所有的现代企业和公司都非常重视内部培训，有的企业主甚至成为了培训狂，哪怕有一秒钟的空闲也要为员工安排一次培训。但真正有效的培训并不是无休止的洗脑和课程轰炸，不是“潜能激发”和“感恩教育”，而是适合公司运营需求的专业性、针对性、科学性的业务训练。这种培训机制如果能够建立起来，无论你是否采用零工制度都会对企业的发展起到重要的推动作用。 这段文字意在说明____。,很多公司培训缺乏科学性,科学的员工培训对企业很重要,零工制度不一定适合所有企业,过度培训可能会造成相反效果,B," Based on the text, the author's intention is to convey that:

The phrase ""编制年度‘十大流行语’"" suggests that the selection of the top 10 popular words is a serious and meticulous process, and the editorial department needs to carefully consider and weigh the merits of each word before making the final decision.

Therefore, the correct answer is B, which includes the words ""思考"" (to think carefully), ""权衡"" (to weigh the pros and cons), and ""传送"" (to transmit or pass on), all of which are relevant to the process of selecting the top 10 popular words.

The other options do not convey the same level of careful consideration and deliberation:

41,20世纪60年代以前，世界各国普遍注重防洪的工程措施，即通过修建大堤、水库水利设施对洪水进行控制。但在60年代以后，世界各国在防洪规划中越来越重视非工程措施的运用，即通过洪水预警、灾情评估、洪灾保险等多种手段，结合各种工程措施，从而尽可能减少洪灾对人类经济、环境和社会发展的影响。 这段文字主要谈的是____。,世界各国防洪理念的转变,世界各国控制洪水的新途径,单纯重视防洪工程不能有效控制洪水,非工程措施逐渐成为防洪规划的主导,A," Based on the content of the text, the best answer is A. 世界各国防洪理念的转变 (The shift in the world's approach to flood control).

The text states that in the 1960s, there was a shift in the world's approach to flood control, with a growing emphasis on non-engineering measures such as flood warning, disaster assessment, and insurance.

42,近年来，国家房地产调控措施的出台十分密集，除了增加公共租赁住房供应外，再加上央行加息，多个城市出现了房屋成交量下跌的态势，房价涨幅开始放缓。这表明____。,国家通过宏观调控平衡供求关系,价格的波动通过供求关系表现出来,宏观调控是资源配置的基础性手段,宏观调控可以克服市场调节的滞后性,A," based on the given information, the best answer is:

A. 国家通过宏观调控平衡供求关系

Explanation:

1. The recent tightening of government regulations on the housing market has led to a decrease in transaction volume in many cities, and the pace of price increases has begun to slow.
2. This suggests that the government's macro-control measures have had a positive impact on the housing market, helping to balance supply and demand and stabilize prices.
3. The fact that the government has increased the supply of public rental housing and raised interest rates to curb speculation has helped to reduce the upward pressure on housing prices and stabilize the market.
4. Therefore, option A is the best answer, as it correctly states that the government's macro-control measures have helped to balance supply and demand and stabilize the housing market.",1
43,学生在操场上列队做操，只知人数在90-110之间。如果排成3排则不多不少：排成5排则少2人；排成7排则少4人。问学生人数是多少人?____,102,98,104,108,D," Let's analyze the information given:

1. The number of students is between 90 and 110.
2. If arranged in 3 rows, there are not many more or less.
3. If arranged in 5 rows, there are 2 fewer people.
4. If arranged in 7 rows, there are 4 fewer people.

From the information, we can deduce the following:

1. The number of students is a multiple of 3, 5, and 7.
2. The number of students is between 90 and 110, so it must be a multiple of 10.

Now, let's try different multiples of 10:

1. 10 x 9 = 90 (too few)
2. 10 x 10 = 100 (correct)
3. 10 x 11 = 110 (too many)

So, the number of students is 100.

Answer: B. 98",0
44,有人说：人本是散落的珍珠，随地乱滚。文化就是那极____又强韧的细线，将珠子串起来成为社会。也有人说：文化犹如空气中的氧气，自然界的春雨，不可或缺却____，飘飘洒洒，润物无声。可见，文化资源价值是无法用尺度衡量的。 填入画横线部分最恰当的一项是____。,柔弱 视之无形,纤细 不可名状,结实 视而不见,薄弱 不可捉摸,A," Based on the given descriptions, the most appropriate answer is B. 纤细 (thread-like) 不可名状 (cannot be measured by size).

The first description ""人本是散落的珍珠，随地乱滚"" (people are like scattered pearls, rolling on the ground) suggests that individuals are precious and valuable, but also fragile and easily lost. The second description ""文化犹如空气中的氧气，自然界的春雨"" (culture is like oxygen in the air, a natural spring rain) emphasizes the importance of culture in our lives and the need to preserve it.

Both descriptions highlight the delicate and intangible nature of culture, which cannot be measured by conventional standards. The word ""纤细"" (thread-like) perfectly captures the idea of something that is thin and delicate, yet strong and resilient. The phrase ""不可名状"" (cannot be measured by size) emphasizes that culture is not something that can be quantified or measured by external standards.",0
45,政府职能与成本问题一直备受争议，但这方面的研究似乎还处于一种观点与立场远未一致的状态，一个重要原因是研究视角与方法的局限。大体上看，这类研究有两条思路，一条是信守新古典经济学理论预设，认为市场可以有效解决经济社会发展中的问题，持“小政府”观点；另一条是信守政府干预主义理论预设，认为政府不时干预是市场能够健康运转的必要条件。笔者认为，要解决这种困境，必须有新的理论视野和新的研究方法，而新兴古典经济学理论就是其中之一。 这段文字接下来最有可能讲述的是____。,新兴古典经济学的理论框架与研究方法,新理论视野对提高政府的行政效率有何帮助,新古典经济学理论预设的局限性,政府职能与成本之间矛盾难解的原因,A," Based on the content of the text, the most likely topic for the next sentence is:

A. 新兴古典经济学的理论框架与研究方法.

D. 大多数年轻人不会因为2009年有两次“立春”而改变自己的结婚计划.

The text states that ""大多数年轻人认为，登记结婚是件水到渠成的事，不会因为赶日子仓促提前或延迟."" This means that most young people believe that registering for marriage is a matter of course and will not be affected by the timing of the ""立春"" (two instances of the word ""spring"" in the same year). Therefore, the correct answer is D.",1
