根据质量与能量的关系：

E = mc^2

其中E是能量，m是质量，c是速度光速。

当α粒子的质量为静止质量的 3 倍时，其动能为静止能量的 3 倍，则：

E = 3mc^2

 substitute m = 3m0 (静止质量)

E = 3(3m0)c^2

E = 9m0c^2

其中m0是α粒子的静止质量，c是速度光速。

所以，α粒子在加速器中被加速，当其质量为静止质量的 3 倍时，其动能为静止能量的 3 倍，即：",0

When the three metal balls are brought together, the electric field lines will be distorted by the presence of the charged balls. The distortion will be greatest near the charged balls, and will decrease with distance.

When ball 1 and ball 2 are brought together, they will experience an attractive force due to the electric field lines being distorted. The force between them will be proportional to the charge on the balls and inversely proportional to the distance between them. Since the distance between them is much greater than the radius of the balls, we can assume that the force between them is proportional to the charge on the balls and inversely proportional to the distance between them.

When ball 3 is brought near ball 1, it will experience an electric field due to the charge on ball 1. This field will cause a force on ball 3, which will cause it to move towards ball 1. Similarly, when ball 3 is brought near ball 2, it will experience an electric field due to the charge on ball 2, which will cause a force on ball 3.

Since the distance between ball 1 and ball 2 is much greater than the radius of the balls, the force between them can be approximated as a Coulomb force, which is proportional to the charge on the balls and inversely proportional to the distance between them. Therefore, the",0

In the experiment, two slits are cut into a plate, and a beam of particles, such as electrons, is passed through the slits. The particles then impinge on a screen behind the slits, creating an interference pattern.

If one of the slits is made slightly narrower (while keeping its center position unchanged), the interference pattern will change. The correct answer is B: the interference pattern will become more pronounced.

The reason for this is that the narrower slit acts as a filter, allowing only particles with certain properties (such as a specific wavelength or energy) to pass through. This causes the particles that pass through the narrower slit to be more coherent, resulting in a more pronounced interference pattern.

Option A is incorrect because the distance between the interference fringes does not change. Option C is also incorrect, as the intensity at the origin does not remain zero. Option D is incorrect because the interference pattern still exists, even though the slit has been narrowed.",0
3,设用频率为ν_1和ν_2的两种单色光，先后照射同一种金属均能产生光电效应。已知金属的红限频率为ν_0，测得两次照射时的遏止电压|U_{a2}|=2|U_{a1}|，则这两种单色光的频率有如下关系：____,ν_2=ν_1-ν_0,ν_2=ν_1+ν_0,ν_2=2ν_1-ν_0,ν_2=ν_1-2ν_0,C," This is a classic problem in the field of optics and photonics. The correct answer is:

C. ν2 = 2ν1 - ν0

Here's the explanation:

When the metal is illuminated with a single color of light, the absorption rate is proportional to the frequency of the light. The absorption coefficient α(ν) is given by:

α(ν) = α0ν^(-γ)

where α0 is a constant, ν is the frequency of the light, and γ is the absorption coefficient exponent.

When the metal is illuminated with two colors of light, the total absorption rate is the sum of the absorption rates for each color. Since the absorption rates are proportional to the frequencies of the light, we can write:

α(ν1 + ν2) = α0(ν1 + ν2)^(-γ)

Now, we know that the stop band of the metal is at frequency ν0. Therefore, we can write:

α(ν1 + ν2) = α0((ν1 + ν2) - ν0)^(-γ) + α0((ν1 + ν2) + ν0)^(-γ)

Since the absorption rate is proportional to the frequency of the light, we can write:

Therefore, the number of molecules per unit volume ($n$) and the total kinetic energy per unit volume ($E_K/V$) will be different for the two gases. However, the mass density ($\rho$) of the two gases will be the same, as it is a thermodynamic property that does not depend on the volume of the system.

Since both oxygen and hydrogen gases have the same temperature, the mean speed of the gas molecules is the same for both gases. Therefore, the ratio of the speed of sound waves through oxygen gas to the speed of sound waves through hydrogen gas is:

V_{O_2}/V_{H_2} = 1/1 = 1

So the correct answer is:

6,两块平玻璃构成空气劈形膜，左边为棱边，用单色平行光垂直入射。若上面的平玻璃以棱边为轴，沿逆时针方向作微小转动，则干涉条纹的____,间隔变小，并向棱边方向平移,间隔变大，并向远离棱边方向平移,间隔不变，向棱边方向平移,间隔变小，并向远离棱边方向平移,A," This is a classic problem in optics, and the correct answer is A. The interval between the fringes will decrease and shift towards the tangent direction.

When the upper glass plate is rotated, the path length of the light passing through the glass plate changes, causing the fringes to shift. The rotation of the glass plate also causes the interference pattern to change, resulting in a decrease in the interval between the fringes. Additionally, the fringes will shift towards the tangent direction, as the light passing through the glass plate is refracted towards the normal of the surface.

Therefore, the correct answer is A. The interval between the fringes will decrease and shift towards the tangent direction.",1
7,在双缝干涉实验中，两缝间距为d，双缝与屏幕的距离为D(D>>d)，单色光波长为λ，屏幕上相邻明条纹之间的距离为____,λD/d,λd/D,λD/(2d),λd/(2D),A," Double-slit experiment is a classic demonstration of the principles of wave-particle duality and the uncertainty principle. In the experiment, two slits are placed closely together, with the distance between them being d, and the distance between the slits and the screen being D (where D is much larger than d). The distance between the centers of the two slits and the screen is also d.

The correct answer is C. λD/(2d), which is the distance between the centers of the two slits and the screen.

Explanation:

The distance between the centers of the two slits and the screen is equal to the wavelength (λ) of the light divided by 2 times the distance between the slits (d):

λD/(2d) = (λ/2)d

This is because the distance between the centers of the two slits is half the distance between the slits, and the distance between the slits and the screen is much larger than the distance between the slits. Therefore, the distance between the centers of the two slits and the screen is equal to half the wavelength of the light, times the distance between the slits.

Answer: C. λD/(2d)",0

A. E1 = E2, U1 = U2

The electric field and potential outside a conducting shell are the same, regardless of whether the shell is filled with an insulating material or not. This is because the electric field and potential are determined by the charge distribution inside the shell, and the charge distribution does not change when the shell is filled with an insulating material.

Therefore, the electric field and potential outside the shell are the same in both cases, and the relationship between the electric field and potential is given by:

E1 = E2, U1 = U2

where E1 and U1 are the electric field and potential outside the shell when it is filled with an insulating material, and E2 and U2 are the electric field and potential outside the shell when it is not filled with any material.",1

We know that the mutual coupling coefficient is proportional to the distance between the two lines and the angle between them. Therefore, to minimize the mutual coupling coefficient, we should choose a configuration that maximizes the distance between the two lines and minimizes the angle between them.

From the given options, the best choice is:

A. Two line segments parallel to each other.

Here's the explanation:

When the first metal ball (ball 1) is charged, it creates an electric field around itself. When the second metal ball (ball 2) is brought close to ball 1, it feels the electric field and becomes charged with the same magnitude and opposite sign as ball 1. The force between ball 1 and ball 2 is due to the electrostatic attraction between the two charges.

Now, when ball 3 is brought close to ball 1, it feels the electric field created by ball 1 and becomes charged with the same magnitude and opposite sign as ball 1. However, since ball 3 is not connected to ball 2, there is no net force between ball 1 and ball 3.

When ball 3 is then brought close to ball 2, it feels the electric field created by ball 2 and becomes charged with the same magnitude and opposite sign as ball 2. Since the charges on ball 1 and ball 2 are equal and opposite, the net force between ball 1 and ball 2 is zero.

Therefore, the force between ball 1 and ball 2 is F/4, since the total force between the three balls is zero.",0
